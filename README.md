# QLDT
 A simple Java application about a university's LMS.
 
 To run the app on your computer, first run the `qldt.sql` file in `./Backup` folder. Then change the localhost port in the main .java file (`QLDT.java` in `src/qldt` folder) to your local SQL server's port, before building the app again.
